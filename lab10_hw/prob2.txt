1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
setTimeout will place callback into timer queue, while setImmediate into check queue. What can happen is,
timer queue can be filled with previous callbacks, and your setTimeout might not be the first one to execute during
eventLoop cycle, while check queue will probably be empty and setImmediate callback will be executed next during the cycle.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
setImmediate callbacks are placed into check queue, nextTick places callback in the next phase of eventLoop.
Typical use - use nextTick if you want a callback to be called before an eventLoop phase starts, setImmediate - when
you want to run callback before I/O queue callbacks.
